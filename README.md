Decoding Bias: A New Lens on Crime Rate Predictions 🕵️‍♂️
# Overview
This project aims to address and mitigate racial biases in crime prediction models using advanced data analysis techniques. By leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we offer a fresh perspective on how data can be processed to ensure fairness and accuracy in predictive modeling.

Objectives 🎯
  * Identify potential racial biases in existing crime prediction datasets.
  * Implement PCA to reduce dimensionality and highlight significant features.
  * Develop a more equitable and unbiased crime prediction model.

Tools & Technologies 🛠
  * R: Primary programming language for data processing and analysis.
  * Scikit-learn: Used for implementing PCA and other machine learning algorithms.
  * Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and insights.
